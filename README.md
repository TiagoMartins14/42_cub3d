# 42_cub3d
Project developed during the Common Core @ 42 Porto

## cub3d
My first RayCaster with miniLibX

### Summary:
This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which is
considered the first FPS ever created. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal
will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, where you will have to find your way.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Requirements

The project is written in C language and needs the **`gcc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

**1. Compiling the project**<p>

### Step 1 / Clone the repository:
```bash
$> git clone git@github.com:TiagoMartins14/42_cub3d.git
```

### Step 2 / Install Minilibx and its dependencies:
Minilibx download:
```bash
$> make download
```
Minilibx dependencies:
```bash
$> sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install xorg libxext-dev zlib1g-dev libbsd-dev
```

### Step 3 / Compile the program:  
```bash
$> make
```

### Step 4 / Run the program:
The map folder has some pre-configured maps for you to test the game environment.  
You're able to create a map of your own and the program will tell you if the map is valid or not.

Map Rules:
There has to be a path for each wall texture
The floor and ceileing colors need to be defined in r,g,b format.
The map layout has to be the last thing on the file.
It has to be a **closed map** (walls around).
The map file extension has to be **'.cub'**.  
The map is composed by 3 elements:  
```
- '0' for empty spaces;
- '1' for walls;
- 'N', 'S', 'E' or 'W' for Player's starting position and spawning orientation;
```

Map example:
```
NO ./textures/tech_1.xpm
SO ./textures/tech_2.xpm
WE ./textures/tech_3.xpm
EA ./textures/tech_4.xpm

F 95,95,95
C 50,50,50

</details>

To run the program, you need to select a map from the existing ones or the one that you've created. For that, you need to put its filename. The map needs to be inside the **maps** folder  
  
```bash
$> ./cub3d map.cub
```

To exit the game, just press 'ESC' on your keyboard or click the 'X' in the game window. **HAVE FUN!**
